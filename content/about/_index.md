I am a writer who navigates the world of technology.

I approach tech with curiosity and a DIY spirit. I prefer straightforward solutions and plain text, and I am the person to call on if all you need is a static site with some words on it. I do not like the taste of snake oil and I’m prepared to hold the line against hypebeasts. I’m a self-host and homelab enthusiast, a free and open-source partisan, and a strong believer in freedom from undue influence.

Self-directed learning is a core part of who I am. I’m currently growing my skills in Prompt Engineering and AI Alignment at the Multiverse School, and Defensive Security Analysis with Hack The Box. And I am always practicing writing. I have several blog posts which talk about my approach to learning, which you can find under the ‘autodidact’ tag. 

Through my work, I aim to build systems that advance both knowledge and sustainability. You're welcome to explore the hypermedia I'm hosting to dive deeper into my thoughts and projects—visit my digital garden, blog, portfolio, GitHub, and Mastodon.
