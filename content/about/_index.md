I am a writer who navigates the world of technology.

I approach tech with curiosity and a DIY spirit. I prefer straightforward solutions and plain text, and I am the person to call on when all you need is a static site with some words on it. I do not like the taste of snake oil and I’m prepared to hold the line against all manner of hypebeast. I’m a self-host and homelab enthusiast, a free and open-source partisan, and a strong believer in freedom from undue influence.

Self-directed learning is a core part of who I am. I’m currently growing my skills in Prompt Engineering and AI Alignment at the Multiverse School, and Defensive Security Analysis with Hack The Box. And I am always practicing writing. I have several blog posts which talk about my approach to learning, which you can find under the ‘autodidact’ tag. 

As a technical writer in IT and Cybersecurity, I value clear communication and problem-solving. Through this work, I aim to contribute to systems which advance efforts in open knowledge, stability, sustainability, and resilience. You're welcome to explore the hypermedia I'm hosting to dive deeper into my thoughts and projects — visit my digital garden, blog, portfolio, GitHub, and Mastodon.
