I am a writer in tech.

I prefer straightforward solutions and plain text. I do not like the taste of snake oil and I’m prepared to hold the line against all manner of hype-hawker. I’m a self-host and homelab enthusiast, free and open source partisan, and reduce reuse recycle evangelist.

You're welcome to explore the hypermedia I'm hosting to dive deeper into my thoughts and projects — visit my digital garden, blog, portfolio, GitHub, and Mastodon.
